Key characteristics of these sophisticated examples:
✅ Realistic, urgent, or fear-based subjects to create emotional pressure.
✅ Impersonate trusted crypto brands with lookalike URLs.
✅ Request actions that give attackers control — credentials, seed phrases, documents, or malware install.
✅ Use plausible language and official-sounding sign-offs.

If you’d like, I can also:

Create a JSON Schema file you can use to validate these programmatically.

Generate Python or Node.js code to check and parse them.

Help you design detections or red flags to look for in a security test.

Would you like me to generate any of those next?
